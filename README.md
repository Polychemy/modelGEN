How Does it Work?
=================
Use our API to send a request to Polychemy's customization server. <br>
Polychemy's Servers will then process your request and genrate the relevant custom Jewelry design based on your specification. A link to download a Low Res 3D Model File for display will be returned to you.<br>
You can then proceed to download the 3D model file or display it on a web browser with WEBGL.<br>

User can then place an order on our order system and have your jwelry manufactured and drop shipped to a location you specify. Payment must be made before hand.
